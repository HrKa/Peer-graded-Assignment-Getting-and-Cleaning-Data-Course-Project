# Peer-graded-Assignment-Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Course-Project
The goal is to prepare tidy data from a Human Activity Recognition database built from the recordings of 30 subjects performing activities of daily living (ADL) while carrying a waist-mounted smartphone with embedded inertial sensors.

The following steps are taken in the script:

 - Load activity labels and feature
 - Loads datasets (training and test data)
 - Loads subject data for each dataset
 - Merges the datasets
 - Extract from merged dataset the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement
 - Provides for the data set descriptive variable names
 - Creates a tidy datasetwith the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
 - Saves result in the file tidy.txt.
